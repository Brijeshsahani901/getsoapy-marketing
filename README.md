# GetSoapy Marketing Site (Next.js, JavaScript)

This is a starter scaffold for the marketing site integrated with GetSoapy (lead forwarding / deep links).
The project uses Next.js + Tailwind CSS (JavaScript, not TypeScript).

## Quick start (after download)

1. Extract the ZIP and `cd getsoapy-marketing`
2. `npm install`
3. Set environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. `npm run dev` to start local dev server on port 3000

## Notes
- Replace the placeholder values and images in `public/images/`.
- API routes are minimal; add your real SMTP, GetSoapy webhook and reCAPTCHA keys before going live.
